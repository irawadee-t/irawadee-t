    <h2>My Work</h2>
    <h3>Neural Engineering</h3>
    <p>Currently, I'm doing neural engineering research at Stanford; I coded the first experimental interface for
        simultaneous gut-brain signal recording and assembled hardware (Mentalab and OpenBCI) to simultaneously record
        gut and brain electrical signals with the end goal of classifying Parkinson's disease subtypes.</p>

    <h3>Social Innovation & Entrepreneurship</h3>
    <p>From ideation to now being acquired - I built Sandee for Good - an online donating platform that connects donors
        to rural nonprofits across all 5 regions of Thailand and has been featured on various global media and news
        channels such as CNN & UNICEF. I’ve also prototyped a Low-Cost Ventilator for rural hospitals and won the
        Thailand Innovation Awards, along with Second place at Taiwan International Science Fair.</p>

    <h3>Programming Languages:</h3>
    <p>C++, C, Python, Javascript/HTML/CSS</p>

    <h3>Libraries/Others:</h3>
    <p>SQL, Git, Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Design, PsychoPy, scipy</p>

    <h2>Fun Things I do!</h2>
    <p>In my free time, I love to coach Taekwondo to 6-12 year-old students (as a black belt Dan-3), play soccer, read
        books, and talk to new people!</p>
