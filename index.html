        Hi I'm <b>Ira</b>, a sophomore at Stanford University studying <b>Computer Science</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm passionate about building <b>software</b> and <b>hardware</b> to create <b>social impact</b> and hope to
        bring you
        along on this
        journey.

    <h2>My Work</h2>
    <h3>Neural Engineering</h3>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">“What if electrical connections between the brain and the stomach can tell us about
        diseases such as Parkinson’s
        and eating disorders?”</p>
    <p>To answer that question, I'm currently doing neural engineering research at Stanford; I coded Coleman lab's first
        experimental interface
        using the PsychoPy framework for simultaneous gut-brain signal recording and assembled hardware (Mentalab and
        OpenBCI) to record gut and brain electrical signals with the end goal of classifying Parkinson's disease
        subtypes.</p>

    <h3>Social Innovation & Entrepreneurship</h3>
    <p>From ideation to now being acquired - I built Sandee for Good - an online donating platform that connects donors
        to rural nonprofits across all 5 regions of Thailand and has been featured on various global media and news
        channels such as <a
            href="https://edition.cnn.com/videos/tv/2019/07/24/young-and-gifted-irawadee-thawornbut.cnn">CNN</a> &
        <a href="https://blogs.unicef.org/east-asia-pacific/girl-no-longer-valid-excuse/">UNICEF</a>. I’ve also
        prototyped a Low-Cost Ventilator for rural hospitals and won the
        Thailand Innovation Awards, along with Second place at Taiwan International Science Fair.
